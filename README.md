# Hello üëã and welcome to our technical challenge!

We‚Äôre glad to have you onboard for this process, and we look forward to seeing your approach to this task.

For this challenge, you'll be working on our Sample Project: https://github.com/MMachado-uy/technical-challenge.

The project consists of a pretty simple *To Do application*, with a frontend, its backend and a database.

## What you need to do

- Fork the project in your Github account
- Choose at least 5 of the tasks detailed in the section below
- Open a Pull Request for each of the tasks you solve

## Requisites

- Pull Requests must remain open; we won‚Äôt evaluate code on the main branch
- Pull Requests must be from and against the main branch; we won‚Äôt evaluate ‚Äúcascading‚Äù PRs
- You have two days to complete the challenge; Pull Requests opened over that time will be ignored
- Two days means 48 hours since the time this email was sent up to the time the last Pull Request was opened

## Tasks
1. As a user, I want to see only the tasks that belong to me
2. As a user, I want to be able to see my previously discarded tasks
3. Update to React 19
4. As a user, I want to be able to know when a task was completed
5. Remove the optional chaining in ActionButton.js:21
6. As a user, I want to be able to change to order of my pending tasks
7. Bug: Completed tasks are being shown in the middle of the pending list
8. As a user, I want to be able to see the current weather (See Annex)
9. Change the API responses and implement GraphQL to the server to improve data structure and performance
  - Implement queries and mutations with Apollo Client hooks
10. The tasks must be refreshed automatically at intervals of no more than 2 seconds, while ensuring the database is queried only once
11. Bug: Can‚Äôt ‚Äúuncomplete‚Äù a task
12. As a user, I want to select multiple tasks and apply actions (complete, discard, delete) in bulk, so I save time
13. As a user, I want to be able to share my task list
14. As a user, I want to mark a task as important, so I can prioritize it in my list
Implement the [‚ÄúAdd Task‚Äù](https://www.figma.com/design/onbFaFEzFWAWPPRuaP9QnY/To-Do-List?node-id=0-1&m=dev&t=jCzEF77RN97jS35r-1) button from the Figma design as a scalable, reusable component that matches the style and works properly in the app

## Annexes
You don‚Äôt need to connect to a real weather service, a mock to a third-party should suffice.
